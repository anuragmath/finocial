### Version
1.0.0

### Tech

Finocial uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* 

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

You need Gulp installed globally:

```sh
$ npm i -g gulp
```

```sh
$ git clone [git-repo-url] dillinger
$ cd dillinger
$ npm i -d
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

### Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins

* Dropbox
* Github
* Google Drive
* OneDrive

Readmes, how to use them in your own application can be found here:

* [plugins/dropbox/README.md] [PlDb]
* [plugins/github/README.md] [PlGh]
* [plugins/googledrive/README.md] [PlGd]
* [plugins/onedrive/README.md] [PlOd]

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantanously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma start
```

### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 80, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t <youruser>/dillinger:latest .
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Once done, run the Docker and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 80 of the host to port 80 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 80:80 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:latest
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

### N|Solid and NGINX

More details coming soon.

#### docker-compose.yml

Change the path for the nginx conf mounting path to your full path, not mine!

### Todos

 - Write Tests
